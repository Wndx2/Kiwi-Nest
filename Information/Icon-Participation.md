Honestly have no idea what to write here, but here are some info on the Server Art thing that's probably coming out soon:

1. Be respectful to people's art:
You disliking a design doesn't give you the right to openly bad-mouth them/their art. If you don't like it, don't see it.

2. Art submit:
We soon might open up a channel for submitting server art only. The transparent version of the server icon will be posted soon in the channel as well.
 
2-1:
The requirements (as of 17.02.2025) are:

- 500x500 pixels at minimum, and 3000x3000 pixels at maximum.
- PNG/JPG file type. GIFs are allowed as an animated icon, but we might not have enough boosts for that.
- Must have our Kiwi-Nest icon (in template folder inside repo).

3. Rewards?
You will get $1000 (server currency ofc) just for submitting. You won't get any rewards for getting it up in the icon. However, if you just spam-submit random-ass icons for money, you will be warned/kicked off our icon programme.
