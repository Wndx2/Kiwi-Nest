### SECTION A: Responsibilities, and Definitions

**A-1**: Your Agreement
	You agree to follow the server rules stated below, Discord's TOS, and community guidelines, including future changes. 
	Discussions regarding Discord Clients (BetterDiscord, Vencord, etc..) are allowed, and we will not punish the ones who do. 

**A-2**: Our Responsibilities
	We take zero responsibility of the security of your account. It is up to you to click whatever link from whoever. 

**A-3**: Your Content
	When we say “your content” in these terms, we mean all the things you add (upload, post, share, stream, etc.) to our server. This includes text, links, GIFs, emoji, photos, videos, documents, or other media. If there is another way for you to add content to our server, it includes that too.  

**A-4**: Bypassing Rules
	Intentionally bending the rules and trying to find loopholes in the rules will result in moderative action. Not every rule is clear-cut and perfectly defined, so avoid trying to prove otherwise. If you feel like you have been treated unfairly by a Moderator, please report it to an Admin. If you feel like you have been treated unfairly by an Admin+, DM `wndx2` 

**A-5**: Bypassing AutoMod
	If your message gets blocked, it was because it was blocked by automod. When this happens, do not try to send your message by changing the letters of words in order to push it through (eg, retard = restarted). This is known as an automod bypass, and you will be punished for it. 

**A-6**: Staff Rights
	You agree that the Staff reserves the right to do take any moderative action in any channel to keep the server safe for everyone. *If we don't like you, you're out*.

**B-2**: No Death Threats, Sexism, Racism, or any kind of Hate Speech
	This includes racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, etc. Comments or jokes that look like hate speech will be punished accordingly. Additionally, having a Swastika on your profile, or sending them will also be punished. Death threats, will also result in punishment. This includes threats that are meant to be jokes.

**B-3**: No Suicidal Comments, or Jokes

	No spamming is tolerated in our server, except in designated channels, where the staff 'clearly' said that "you can spam in this channel".

**B-6**: Avoid Sensitive Topics
	We want to try and respect everyone’s opinions. If you do happen to talk about a sensitive topic in a 'non-designated channel', and drama does cause, moderative actions will be handed out. 

**B-7**: No Leaking Private Information, or talking about Doxxing, Swatting, Raiding
	Any threat or joke about raiding, doxxing, or swatting someone will result in a permanent ban. Sharing doxxing information is also considered a bannable offense, even if you are trying to make mods aware of it. When in doubt, create a ticket.

**B-8**: English Only
	Our server is an English-speaking server, as well as we may not have the moderation to moderate in other languages (we do not intend to ever allow other languages either, so do not ask). Google Translate does exist if you need to use that.

	Any drama caused in any channels may be purged without prior notice. If you happen to cause any sort of drama, you will be punished accordingly.

**B-10**: No Mini-Modding
	Mini-modding (also known as backseat moderating) is correcting someone’s behavior when you are in fact not a moderator. This is not allowed as it is annoying, and we will punish you if you do.

	Switching voice channels fast may flood our logs, and we will warn you if you tend to do that.

**C-3**: No Recording Voice Channels

These are subject to change at any time without prior notice, and it is your responsibility to check them out regularly to make sure that you're following the rules.

Although we aren't **that** strict with rules, if we do have to punish a member at some point, we will be strictly following these rules.
